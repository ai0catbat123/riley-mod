scs_brief.1.d:0 "The state of our empire is dreadful to say the least as we continue to spend lavishly on your penthousses and zoos of bannanadiles. Now we are at war with some dogs that rose up in our eastern territories which have a similar army size to us but much more land. We are still scared of the threat to the west who might take advantage of the war we are in to reclaim our territories. In other news we are the only communists in the friendship region, we are alone in the struggle of the workers. Domestically our power isnt secure as a theocratic movement involving mario is rising in popularity. This could and would mean the end of communism in the friendship region possibly forever."

Taylan Santiago said "We are the heros of the workers long live bannanadile!". If his state can rearm and reorginize it may have a chance of reuniteing the friendship region."
dog_victory.1.d:0 "The dogs after rising up against the communists have captured the communists bases and now have complete and utter control over there sphere. Though it is asked if the dogs will believe the claims on the west or simply attempt to aproach the ass republic to secure an alliance. Time will tell..."
dog_brief.1.d:0 "The state of the revolution is looking up, we have pushed the damn commies back to near their capital and as we push General Dog has a smile. Yet as we aproach their capital we also aproach the border of the ass republic we must prepare our foreign policy. Nonetheless we are about to secure our freedom from the commies and we may be able to save others from their tyrants."
scs_brief.2.d:0 "We have conquered the stupid dogs but we need to figure out how we will treat the dogs we could either use them as commanders or publicly excute them. What should we do?"
ril_crash.0.d:0 "News has just come from the reich that their central economy has collapsed. Inflation is rising in the reichsmark and countries are adding sanctions to the reich but they have been hit too. Since after the first friendship war trading has been common across the friendship region as they were now the dominant power. Though now after this new devoplement countries are shuting down their economies to deal with their new found economic problem."
scs_brief.3.d:0 "The secretary for the dear leader walks in paper in hand and begins speaking "This is the general report for the dear leader adressing the future and now..We have more individual points for the economy, military and foreign policy. The current domestic situation as stated before is under control but require strict watch. We are secure in our power for now and our territories have no resitance and we are currently hoping to adress our foreign policy towards the rest of the friendship region. Have a good day dear leader " She then walked out of the room and the dear leader had to chose what to adress first the economy or maybe the foreign policy the choice is his."
scs_trial.4.d:0 "As the dog generals walk to their holding area and they looked pensive the judge said outloud "General Riley, General lolla, General Marz, General Darko and General Leo and any others who may be in th room the council and committee for the socialst afairs of this great nation have sentanced you all to the guillotine". The room lay silent as the dogs in shackles are moved out back and as the clock in the town square rings signifying noon heads began falling into a basket. Any of their associates were simply shot instead of such a roylist death."
 scs_crash.0.d:0 "One of the worst days to be the leader of the country and unfortunately taylan found himself there. As he looked out his window to see his people running panicing he thought to himself how he got here. Right then his secratary comes in with a report. 'That was quick' 'well sir, you rushed me' the leader had a stern face but let it go and dismised her and read... The crash was due to our secret economic and trade ties with the reich so when the reich's economy crashed we did too and as in such circumstances multiple economic recovery plans have been drawn up to save us from starvation and inflation. Signed Economic minister dile"
scs_mario.6.d:0 "Mario and his goons have feeding the public ill information for too long and we shall put a stop to his misinformation campaign now! With a bullet a knife whatever it takes to shut him up. Taylan interupts his general 'me and mario go way back' he smiles looking out his window 'we used to put up posters calling the ass republicians dicks I cant believe it came to this' the general chimes in 'sir you said it yourself...'
