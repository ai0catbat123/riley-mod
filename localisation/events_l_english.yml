scs.1.d:0 "The state of our empire is dreadful to say the least as we continue to spend lavishly on your penthousses and zoos of bannanadiles. Now we are at war with some dogs that rose up in our eastern territories which have a similar army size to us but much more land. We are still scared of the threat to the west who might take advantage of the war we are in to reclaim our territories. In other news we are the only communists in the friendship region, we are alone in the struggle of the workers. Domestically our power isnt secure as a theocratic movement involving mario is rising in popularity. This could and would mean the end of communism in the friendship region possibly forever."
